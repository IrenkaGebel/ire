      <p id="intro">
        Ire works at the intersection of writing, design and organizing. With a
        background in sculpture and art history, they try to filter each task
        and job through a million questions. This often means their work is
        confusing, illegible or off the grid. They struggle with visibility in
        the arts but remain supported by their chosen family. Currently they’re
        thinking about how to bring a sense of a political home into their
        labor. [email] ire3030@icloud.com
